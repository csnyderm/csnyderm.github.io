							<h2 class="text-white">Hi, I'm Cole Snyder!</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							I am a graduating senior studying computer security in the Bachelor of Innovation program at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs. 
							Since middle school, I've participated in CyberPatriot, the largest youth cyber competition, and helped teach teams as a mentor while in college. 
							In high school, I also assisted and led various cybersecurity education camps for elementary and middle school students. 
							When I'm not leading workshops, I enjoy reading and learning new topics or coding in my free time, often working on websites, developing my skills in Python, or learning a new language.
						</p>

										<p>
											Experience teaching cybersecurity to students at varying age ranges. Often, this was done through assisting and teaching cybersecurity 
											camps as an Education Assistant for the National Cybersecurity Center. Apart from teaching and leading activities in the camps, I also gained 
											experience creating and managing virtual machines for students to use, and setting up and managing the laptops utilized for the camps.
										</p>
										<p>
											I gained further experience teaching students through working as a STEM Club Coach for the University of Colorado Colorado Springs. 
											Here, I would focus on teaching STEM topics, often through after-school STEM clubs located at various local elementary and middle schools. 
											I was in charge of planning and leading each club. 
											For high schoolers, we would provide workshops on Saturdays at the university where we would spend a day teaching topics with more depth.
										</p>
										<p>
											Finally, I also developed HTML and CSS skills, as well as some marketing skills, through working as a Marketing Assistant for Willow Crest Marketing Solutions. My job was to post blogs 
											and manage the blog's SEO for various clients, which at times necessitated manually setting the blog's CSS.

										<p>
											For programming languages, I feel most comfortable with Python, C, Powershell, and HTML & CSS. I also have some experience with C++, C#, 
											Java, and SQL to a lesser degree, as well as some experience in JavaScript. Find out more about how I've used them on the projects page.
										</p>
										<p>
											Aside from developing code, I also have experience working with networks and setting up networking systems. I have also utilized Wireshark for monitoring and tracking network information. 
											Finally, I've gained experience in Active Directory, along with ethical hacking and utilizing several tools in the Kali Linux Suite such as Metasploit, JackTheRipper, and cupp.
										</p>
										<p>
											I have also managed to obtain an IT Fundamentals certification through the TestOut Corporation.

									<div class="dropdown-content text-base">
										<p>
											In addition to my technical knowledge, I have experience working in multi-disciplinary teams as a team member and leader. As a team member, I was able to learn from my peers and 
											provide my own input in order to successfully complete projects on time. While working with the National Cybersecurity Center, I worked with the camp instructors to ensure 
											students were able to follow along and to give students extra assistance and answer questions when necessary.
											
										</p>
										<p>
											As a leader, I learned to do more than delegate tasks, but to learn and take feedback from team members to ensure everyone's skills were utilized and to provide assistance when necessary.
											I also learned to carry my voice to reach large crowds and speak clearly, which allowed me to lead workshops and speak to clients.
											Finally, throughout all these experiences, I was able to
											develop my skills in explaining and translating technical speech to non-technical indiviudals, with the details that they needed.

										<p>
											Through my work and education, I have had the opportunity to complete a number of trainings and gain certifications for them including:
											<ol>

												</li>
											</ol>
											Through the course of several classes, I have also gained some familiarity with a number of regulatory standards and frameworks which are utilized in critical infrastructure. 
											These experiences have given me the chance to explore many areas of cybersecurity and other career fields. It has also given me the chance to learn about causes and movements
											related to them I might be interested in, and has provided me the chance to learn new skills.
